<p>기존에 연금 상품 관련 서비스는 직접 사용자가 연금 상품에 대해 검색을 해야 했습니다. 저희는 사용자들에게 편리함을 주고자 이와 같은 서비스를 개발하였습니다.

<h3> 세부 기능 </h3>

<h4>기능3</h4>
<p>Roborun expressed 2D objects in the existing Chrome dinosaur games as 3D objects.</p>
<p>As the name Roborun suggests, we used robot characters, not dinosaur characters.</p>
<p>In addition, cactus, which used to be existing obstacles, was diversified into 3D stone and cactus to form obstacles randomly.</p>
<p>The background is also composed of 3D in the existing 2D configuration, expressing the robot character running.</p>

<h4> 기능4</h4>
<p>When the game starts for the first time, it starts by clicking on the keyboard.</p>
<p>When you enter the game, you can make the robot jump through the space bar, which avoids obstacles.</p>

<h4> 기능5 </h4>
<p>When the game starts, the score continues to increase in proportion to time.</p>
<p>If the robot fails to avoid obstacles, the game is over and the score increase stops, resulting in the final score being printed.</p>
